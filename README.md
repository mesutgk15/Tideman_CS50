# Tideman_CS50
It is a project of election simulation from CS50 curriculum psets. Simulates an election in a ranked voting system rather than a plurality of the winner.
Usage will be declaring candidates as command-line arguments while running program. 
Each candidates votes are compared against each other and creates a "directed graph" of winning edges. Program avoids cycles while creating edges. 
Source of the graph will be declared as the winner of the election.
